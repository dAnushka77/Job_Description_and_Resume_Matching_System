## üìÇ Features

- **Job Description Input**: Recruiters can input detailed job descriptions into the system.
- **Resume Upload**: Candidates can upload their resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
- **Matching Algorithm**: The system uses the Tf-Idf Vectorizer algorithm to compute similarity scores between job descriptions and resumes.
- **Result Display**: Displays the top 3 resumes with their respective similarity scores to assist recruiters in decision-making.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Job Description Input**: Recruiters enter a job description in a text area.
2. **Resume Upload**: Candidates upload resumes in supported formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
3. **Text Extraction**: The system extracts text from the uploaded resumes using PyPDF2, docx2txt, or text file parsing.
4. **Vectorization**: Job descriptions and resumes are vectorized using Tf-Idf.
5. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity scores are computed between the job description and resumes.
6. **Top Matches**: The system identifies the top 3 resumes with the highest similarity scores and displays them to the recruiter.
